  **Yes, I do believe it's possible to contribute to Zulip during the course of this semester. Zulip has a chat channel where new contributors can talk directly to more experienced contributors. Furthermore, Zulip has an extensive documentation that allows new contributors to be caught up to speed on how Zulip works. In discussions regarding pull requests and issues, maintainers are very active and always willing to help. It's worth mentioning that Zulip has a bot that directs contributors to relevant information in an efficient manner.**

### Installation
  **The project took a little over an hour to install thanks to Zulip's "Development environment installation" documentation. The documentation goes step by step starting with requirements and prerequisites. The documentation provides different installation procedures depending on your operating system. After each step is completed the documentation lets you know what a successful output looks on your terminal and on your browser. Once you determine you were successful in each step, the documentation directs you to your new step. Most steps included issues you may run into and how to fix those issues.**
