### Summary
1. Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the course of a semester?
**I definitely think it will be a challenge, but I am more than willing to contribute to this open source software project. They are very active, in either discussion forms or issues. I am very intrigued about the idea of working on this project because of the overall goal that they have. Computer vision software is the future, and I want to become part of that. I understand that the issues might be a bit complex, but I am willing and passionate to sit down and understand it. I definitely think that this is the direction I want to head in. I definitely wish there was a code of conduct page or tests repository, it would have definitely solidify the work by tenfold.**
