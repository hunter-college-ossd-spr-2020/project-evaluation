### Summary
Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester?
**Edmund Adewu: Although the project is primarily written in C++, the sheer amount of dependencies required may prove problematic in regards to storage occupancy and file management. In addition, the function descriptions lean towards the technical side. I will have to decline working on this project.**
