* The issues stay open in a range of one day to 5 months.
<br>

5. Is there active discussion on the issues? Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues.

* There are some discussion, but not a lot. They rarely go above 10 replies and most of them are figured out without outside help.
<br>

* It doesn't appear that they have any tags specifically on difficulty levels.
<br>

11. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open. Take the five most recently closed ones and look at when each was first reported. Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.

* The average is usually one day for an open pull request to remain unanswered. Even with the ones that weren't merged immediately, they usually are the ones with a lot of discussions with contributors critiquing the request before they allow the merge.
<br>

12. Is there active discussion on the pull requests? Use the same method as you did for the issues.

* Usually no, as most of the requests are merged on the same day. So it would appear that most of the community are at least experienced with coding. The only discussions are with pull requests that needed a review.
<br>

### Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it? Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough.

* There is a CONTRIBUTING document and it is very clear on what they expect from contributors and how they can contribute. However, the document seems to expect some experience from contributors with the code they listed.
<br>

2. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that violate it?

* There doesn't appear to be a CODE OF CONDUCT document.
<br>

3. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations.

* The maintainers respond helpfully and contructively with the issues. 
<br>

4. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?

* In most of the discussions, the people are friendly and courteous.
<br>

5. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?

* There isn't a lot of discussion within the repo unless it's a rare thread with more than one reply. And even then the discussions are more straight to the point than worrying about courtesy. So no, maintainers don't spend time on the discussion posts to thank people for the contribution.
<br>

### Summary

1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the course of a semester?

* I personally feel that people in this course, who don't have a lot of experience in coding, would feel more comfortable contributing to this project near the end of the course or at least when they know more coding. The project seems that expects its contributors to be experienced in coding.
