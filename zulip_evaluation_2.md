### Summary
Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester? 

**Yes, I believe that it is possible to contribute to this project within the course of a semester. Not only is the project well-documented but their developer chat channel is also new-comer friendly. It provides people interested in contributing to the project with a thororugh and clear outline of how to contribute. The community promotes positivity and this is reflected in the project's pull request and issue conversations. The project's GitHub page and *zulip chat* are very active (with communications occuring within minutes of this post). This level activity in the project makes it possible to claim an issue to work on today with almost immediate feedback. Also the project is interesting and provides new-comers a myriad of ways to get started (documenting, making bug requests, responding to issues and pull requests,solving issues, adding features...)**

### Installation

**Installing this project and setting up its Vagrant development environment took over an hour. I followed this guide for my computer: [Development Environment (for first-timers)](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/setup-vagrant.html). The guide was super helpful and straightforward. It had a useful troubleshooting section for installation issues and development environment issues. It was cool to connect the information collected above to a tangible product. While the project didn't really capture my attention at first, seeing the product in action definetly piqued my curiosity in contributing to it.**
