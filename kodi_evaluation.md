   **8 commits.**

1. When was the most recent commit?

   **Wednesday 3/18.**

1. How many issues are currently open?

   **461 issues**

1. How long do issues stay open?
Take the five most recently closed issues and look at when each was first reported.
Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.

   2. opened yesterday closed today total 2 days
   3. opened 2 days ago closed 2 days ago total 1 day
   4. opened 5 days ago closed 5 days ago total 1 day
   5. opened 6 days ago closed 5 days ago total 2 days
   ((1+2+1+1+2)=7 )/ 5 = **1.4 days**

   **30 contributors**

1. How many open pull requests are there?

   **134 pull requests**

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time?
Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
Take the five most recently closed ones and look at when each was first reported.
Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.

   1. closed 2 days ago opened 2 days ago. total 1 day
   2. closed 5 days ago opened 5 days ago. total 1 day
   3. merged yesterday opened 6 days ago. total 2 days
   4. merged yesterday opened 7 days ago. total 7 days.
   5. closed 5 days ago opened 6 days ago. total 2 days.
   ((1+1+2+7+2)=13) / 5= **pull requests remain open for an average of 2.6 days. So a reletively short time.** 

1. Is there active discussion on the pull requests?
Use the same method as you did for the issues.

   **Yes there is.**

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months?

### Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough.

   **Yes, there is a CONTRIBUTING document. It is clear and concise.**

violte it?

   **There is no CODE OF CONDUCT document.**

Are responses generally constructive?
Read the issue conversations.

   **Occasionally there seems to be some rude interactions and blunt responses, but this is because some contributors do not speak english as their first language(as stated in the README file). All in all, the responses are constructive and helpful if the issue is valid.**

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?

   **I wouldn't neccessarily use the word "friendly" but blunt instead. This is likely due to a language barrier, but I wouldnt go as far as calling the conversations "unfriendly".**

1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?

   **No, not unless it is an issue the maintainer sees as critical.**

### Summary
Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester?
   **I personallly love the response rate for issues and pull requests, but the conversations in some of these can be fustrating. Many people seem to not read the README file and use the issue board as a place to express troubleshooting issues or personal issues, instead of possible updates and bugs found in the system. Until this project gets a CODE OF CONDUCT document and contributors reference and use it consistently, this project is an ill fit for the short span of this class.**
