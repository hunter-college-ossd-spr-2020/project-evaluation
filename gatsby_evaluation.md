## Code Base
1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
JavaScript

1. What is the development environment? For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux? Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install?
Cross-Platform CLIs,  Node.js, Git, and the Gatsby CLI . Yes, there are instructions for how to download, build, and install their application.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database, graphics, web development, or other libraries?
Depends mostly on the Javascript UI library React because it is framework based on React, and GraphQL since Gatsby has a unique interface that allows users to communicate with GraphQL APIs.
	

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make a judgment based on your random sample.
After browsing multiple source code files, I believe that the code is neither extremely difficult nor easy to understand. There are a few files in the project in which you may understand what is going on in the code because of its explicit simplicity. However, there are also numerous other files that contain a high volume of code which would require a deeper knowledge/understanding of the coding language and the general flow of the project.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code are in it, perhaps on OpenHub.
Yes, this is a big project. According to OpenHub, there are about 172,000 lines of code in this project.

1. Does the repository have tests?
Yes, the repository has tests. I have specifically seen from the Gatsby Github that there are Integration Tests and End to End Tests.


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself?
There is clear documentation in the code itself, however, the documentation is not as detailed as I believe it should be and the project does not contain as much documentation as I would like. There are parts which give a succinct singular sentence of what the code below it may be doing but I believe there should be a heightened amount of this documentation in the files. I believe with further research and building upon your knowledge of the project, it would be easier to read the code.
1. Is there documentation about the design?
No, there is no documentation about the design from what I have researched.

## Activity Level
1. How many commits have been made in the past week?
72 commits were made in the past week (the week of February 16th).

1. When was the most recent commit?
The most recent commit was today: Monday, February 24, 2020.

1. How many issues are currently open?
There are currently 581 issues opened at this time.

1. How long do issues stay open? Take the five most recently closed issues and look at when each was first reported. Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
Issue #21699: Originally opened 4 hours ago, closed 1 hour ago.
Issue #21690: Originally opened yesterday, closed 21 hours ago.
Issue #21681: Originally opened 2 days ago, closed yesterday.
Issue #21680: Originally opened 2 days ago, closed 6 hours ago.
Issue #21669: Originally opened 2 days ago, closed 2 days ago.
In conclusion, issues do not stay open for long. From the most recently closed issues, we may determine that issues stay open for around a day (possibly even less) before they are closed.

1. Is there active discussion on the issues? Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues.
Yes, there are active discussions in many of the issues that were both opened and closed just a few days ago and from past weeks.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.?
Yes, the issues are thoroughly tagged with their respective difficulties. There are a decent amount of tasks for beginners, but also a great deal of tasks for more experienced contributors.

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months?
There were 1,504 issues closed in the past six months.

1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project?
Yes, the project currently has 2,994 contributors maintaining the project.

1. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months?
The project has had about 58 active contributors in the past 6 months.

1. How many open pull requests are there?
There are currently 146 open pull requests.

1. Do pull requests remain unanswered for a long time? Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open. Take the five most recently closed ones and look at when each was first reported. Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
Most pull requests are answered very quickly. The average time span that the most recently closed pull requests were open for was about one day.

1. Is there active discussion on the pull requests? Use the same method as you did for the issues.
Yes, there are active discussions in many of the pull requests that were both opened and closed just a few days ago and from past weeks. (One open pull request even has 110 comments in the discussion section!)

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months?
There were 2,763 pull requests opened within the past six months. Of those, 132 are still open and 2,631 are closed.

1. When was the last pull request merged?
The last pull request was merged 23 hours ago.

## Welcomeness and Community
1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it? Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough.
There’s a CONTRIBUTING document. It’s easy to read and understand. It provides links of tutorials for new contributors. It gives a list of ways on how and where to participate in the community. The contributors can also find a set of instructions on how to open a pull request, label an issue, file an issue, and etc on its CONTRIBUTING document. 

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that violate it?
There’s a CODE OF CONDUCT document. It also has consequences for acts that violate it. For example, the Gatsby team will remove someone from the GitHub repository and/or block them on social media. 

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations.
90% of the issues were tagged. The responses are generally constructive. People are providing links and screenshots to help resolving the issues.

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?
People are friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat. They do respond very quickly. There’s a tag for contributors to ask question or bring up a discussion. People are helping each other tackling each issues, and they also ask follow-up questions.
Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?
The maintainers do thank people for their contributions. Even with opening up a good issue, the maintainers will thank them for pointing that out and thank them for using Gatsby under almost every issue. The maintainers also send out some Gatsby gifts for the contributor, as well as inviting them to join the Gatsby organization on GitHub.

## Summary
Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the course of a semester?
Yes, this is definitely a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the course of a semester. From the research we have done, it is extremely evident that there is an extremely active community. There are over 13,000 commits, over 500 issues open, and over 100 pull requests. In conjunction with this, there are 8,000 closed issues and over 12,000 closed pull requests. Furthermore, there are many issues that are tagged and labeled which make it extremely accessible for those who are trying to find and work on issues fast and efficiently. Lastly, there is an abundance of community responsiveness and welcomess, which is exactly what one would aim for when working on a project. It is apparent that the community actively works on this project and generally enjoys working on the project and working with others. Therefore, this project is extremely suitable to work on during the course of a semester.
